# Student Registration System

Student Registration System is a simple and responsive student registration system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete student records including full name, email, student ID, and mobile number. The application dynamically manages the data in the browser using localStorage, ensuring records persist across sessions without the need for a backend.

## Features

- Add new student details including full name, email, student ID, and mobile number.
- View all submitted student records in a structured and responsive table format.
- Update student information with ease using the built-in edit option.
- Remove individual student records with a single click.
- All data is stored in the browser's local storage — no backend required.
- Works smoothly across all devices — desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- Ensures that all inputs (like email and mobile number) follow valid formats, with clear error messages.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (TailwindCSS)
